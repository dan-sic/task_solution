# Dynamic maps task solution

This is a project I've made as a part of a recruitment process. This is an Angular project, which dynamically displays positions of vehicles on the map.

## Project functionalities

To the predefined scaffolding I've added the following functionalities:

* Displaying vehicles on the map, according to their initial position
* Dynamically updating position of vehicles, based on updates comming from an API
* Displaying planned routes for each vehicle
* Displaying history of fixed number of previous positions for each vehicle
* Displaying a list of all vehcles with corresponding data
* Adding search functionality for list of vehicles

## Technologies used

* Angular 7
* Mapbox GL JS
* ngx-mapbox-gl


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
